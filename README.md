# Throne Rooms

**An Android App By: Vivid Pink**

Throne Rooms is an application designed to make taking a number 2 on campus, a not so shitty experience.

Ever have troubles getting to the nearest bathroom when you *really* have to go?
Having trouble finding one of the elusive gender neutral or family friendly bathrooms on campus?

Luckily Throne Rooms is here to wipe up all of your problems.

Our application stores a database of all the porcelain potties on campus that can be filtered by your needs and sorted by distance from your current location.
It's as simple as opening up the app and selecting what kind of loo you want to go too.
Go on and give it a try. Because ad Vivid Pink; your number 2, is our number 1 priority!
